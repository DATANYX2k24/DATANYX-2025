# Moon Texture Instructions

To use a moon texture with this component:

1. Download a high-quality moon texture image (preferably 2048x2048 or higher)
2. Name it "moon.jpg" 
3. Place it in this directory (/public/textures/moon.jpg)

Some good sources for moon textures:
- NASA's image gallery
- Solar System Scope textures
- Three.js examples
- Free texture websites like Poly Haven

The component will automatically use the texture if found, otherwise it will fall back to a simple gray material.
